  <div class="ZoosParagraph">A zoo is a place where a number of wildlife species are housed in separate enclosures. Habitats similar to the natural habitats of the animals are re-created for them to live in. The animals are fed and are given water to drink. They are kept in hygienic surroundings. An animal that falls ill or develops a disease is given medical attention by trained veterinarians and nursed back to health.</div>

    <div class="more-text">Zoos and similar facilities that publicly exhibit wild animals have existed throughout history, beginning as far back as Ancient Egypt. In the past, animals were kept in small cages and used by rulers to display their wealth and satisfy the curiosity and fascination surrounding wild creatures. Societyâ€™s views about zoos have changed. No longer are people willing to view animals pacing nervously back and forth behind bars. Instead, the public has begun to express concern for the welfare of the animals.</div>
